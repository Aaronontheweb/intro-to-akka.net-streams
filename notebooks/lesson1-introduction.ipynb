    "# What is Akka.Streams?\n",
    "[Akka.Streams](https://getakka.net/articles/streams/introduction.html) is a high-level abstraction built on top of Akka.NET actors; it's general purpose implementation of the [Reactive Streams specification](https://www.reactive-streams.org/) for .NET and offers a [variety of built-in components](https://getakka.net/articles/streams/builtinstages.html), high performance, a succinct LINQ-like syntax, and a highly composable and [customizable development experience](https://getakka.net/articles/streams/custom-stream-processing.html)."

    "## What is Akka.Streams Used For?\n",
    "There are three compelling reasons to want to use Akka.Streams:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Making asynchronous producer-consumer models safe and effective** - through the use of Reactive Streams, and more specifically through the use of \"backoff\" mechanisms that tell producers when they are overwhelming a slower-moving consumer with ouptut, we can prevent asynchronous systems from failing by helping producers slow down, aggregate, combine, debounce, or otherwise filter their output to help match the downstream input rates. This is done dynamically, so when consumers begin to move faster producers will also keep up.\n",
    "2. **Providing re-usable asynchronous event-driven programming patterns** - Akka.Streams provides concise formulas for common event-driven patterns such as batching, debouncing, aggregating, filtering, and more.\n",
    "3. **Shovel-ready integration with non-Akka.NET technologies** - through the [Alpakka project](https://alpakka.getakka.net/) and others it's easy to connect Akka.NET actors to Kafka, Azure EventHubs, AWS Kinesis / SNS / SQS, CSV files, SignalR, AMQP, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository is mostly focused on the syntax for how to use Akka.Streams, how it works, and when you should use different portions of it."

    "## A Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Akka.Streams, we only need to install the [Akka.Streams NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Akka.Streams/).\n",
    "\n",
    "> PS> Install-Package Akka.Streams\n",
    "\n",
    "And then we need to create an `ActorSystem`, since Akka.Streams uses Akka.NET actors internally."

    "\n",
    "1. A [`Source<T>` stage](https://getakka.net/api/Akka.Streams.Dsl.Source-2.html), which emits events - something as simple as an `IEnumerable<T>` can be converted into a `Source<T>`.\n",
    "2. Optionally, one or more [`Flow<T>` stages](https://getakka.net/api/Akka.Streams.Dsl.Flow-3.html) which can be used to do all sorts of things: filtering, aggregating, projections, buffering, and so on.\n",
    "3. Finally, a [`Sink<T>` stage](https://getakka.net/api/Akka.Streams.Dsl.Sink-2.html) - which is where the events in the stream complete processing. The simplest way to imagine a `Sink<T>` is as an asychronous `foreach` loop.\n",
