    "Similar to [how actors are programmed to handle their children's failures, primarily by restarting them](https://petabridge.com/blog/akkadotnet-actors-restart/), so too can Akka.Streams stages be handled using some metadata we provide during stream construction.\n",

    "In this case, however, we can simplify our error handling by configuring the underlying actors that are created by the `IMaterializer` to execute the graph to simply restart in the event of a `DivideByZeroException`. This is exactly what we did when we passed in these `ActorAttributes`:\n",
