When the `Delay<T>` backpressures, however, the grouping will stop and the original `Source<int>` will stop being read from until the downstream is ready to process again.\n",

    "The sums are growing larger because we're selecting larger integers in the sequence - and the tickcount is growing larger because the processing delay in computing the sum is being observed in real-time as the stream is processed.\n",
